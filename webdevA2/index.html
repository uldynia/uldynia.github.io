            <div class="article">
                <p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine, initially released in 2005 to support the creation
                    of games for
                    the Mac OS X and has since grown to support multiple platforms like PC, Android & iOS and video game
                    consoles like the PS5.<br><br>To get started with Unity, <a href="https://unity.com/download"
                        target="_blank">head
                        to Unity's download page, and download
                        the
                        installer for Unity Hub.</a> Unity Hub is an application that lets you manage your versions of
                    Unity and
                    allows you to add modules to each version of Unity.<br><br>When you open Unity Hub for the first
                    time,
                    you
                    will see the screen as shown in the second picture. In the top left hand corner, select the icon of
                    the person to sign up for a Unity
                    account: Personal license. The personal license is free. </p>

            <div class="article">
                <p>After you have signed up and accepted the personal license, the next step would be to install Unity.
                    In the menu on the left side, select Installs. On the top right side, select Install Editor, and
                    install the recommended version. In this case it would be 2022.3.5f1.
                    <br><br>You'll need to install Microsoft Visual Studio Community and Windows Build Support. You are
                    also
                    encouraged to download WebGL Build Support so you can upload your games to the web.
                    <br><br>Once everything is installed, go to the Projects tab and create a New Project using the
                    button
                    in the top right hand corner. Select 2D Core, and rename your project and location as you wish.
                    We'll be working with 2D for now to get familiar with the Unity Editor, but nothing much will change
                    when moving to 3D. Your project will automatically launch after creation.
                    <br><br>If you close the editor and would like to open your project again, launch Unity Hub and
                    select
                    your project.

                <p>By following the steps in the previous pages, you should have the editor open, with nothing on your
                    scene. The editor appears to be intimidating at first, but I'll walk you through.<br>You may view
                    the Definitions section to understand some terms used by Unity, or jump to the Getting Familiar With
                    The
                    Editor section where we will be creating a few GameObjects in our Scene and assigning a few
                    Components to them.

            <div class="article">
                <p>We're going to add a GameObject to our scene. Within the Grey area of the Hierarchy tab, right-click,
                    select 2D Object, go to sprites, and select Square.

                    You now have a Square in your Scene. In the Middle Top corner of your scene, select the Play button
                    to see what it looks like in the game. The Square does not do anything, as it is simply a GameObject
                    with two components: its Transform and a Sprite Renderer. You can see a GameObject's components by
                    going to the Inspector tab.

                    The Transform is a component that determines the position of the object in your game, it's rotation
                    and scale. While the game is being played, select your Square in the hierarchy and play around with
                    the values in the Transform component. By modifying Transform, position the Square such that it is
                    to the left of the Screen and rotated at an angle.

            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <p>Now that we understand what the Transform component does, we can focus on the second component that
                    comes with the Square. We will now focus on the Sprite Renderer. The Sprite Renderer is what gives
                    the Square an appearance. Try changing the colour of the Square to Green.

                    Before we proceed, is the Play button still highlighted? If so, click it to stop the preview of the
                    game. You'll see that you are no longer on the Game tab, and instead sent back to the Scene tab. The
                    changes you made while in Preview mode were also reverted. Do be careful with this when testing out
                    changes in your game.

                    Now that your Square has been reverted, we can experiment with new components that aren't attached
                    to the cube. With the cube selected in the hierarchy, under the Inspector tab click Add Component,
                    and add the Rigidbody2D component. Do check that you have added the 2D one instead of the regular
                    Rigidbody component. Once you have added the Rigidbody component, preview the scene.

                <p>In the earlier exercises, you added a bunch of Components to a GameObject. But just what are all of
                    these? Think of it this way. A game is made out of Scenes. Think of them as different spaces. In the
                    example on the right, the
                    first image shows a Scene that serves as the title screen of the game. When pressing the play
                    button, a new Scene is loaded. This Scene serves to show the main game.

                    A scene is made of GameObjects. A GameObject is an object that is in your game. This includes your
                    player, coins, and enemies.

                    A GameObject consists of components. Components are what gives a GameObject behaviour, such as how
                    it appears in game, how it interacts with other game objects, and how it reacts to user input.
